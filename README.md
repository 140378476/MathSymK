This project aims to provide a modern and easy-to-use Math library in Kotlin. The library focuses mainly on symbolic calculation, but also include other components such as advanced linear algebra, analytic geometry.



## Development

Currently, this project will be migrated and redesigned from my other math lib [Ancono](https://github.com/140378476/Ancono).

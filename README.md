This project aims to provide a modern and easy-to-use Math library in Kotlin. The library focuses mainly on symbolic calculation, but also include other components such as advanced linear algebra, analytic geometry.

The project is still under development. 
Currently, it includes
- Interfaces for algebraic structures, such as `Group`, `Ring`, `Field`, etc.
- Basic implementations of algebraic structures 
  - `Fraction` 
  - `Polynomial` and `Multinomial`
  - `Vector`, `Matrix` and `Tensor`
- Utilities for number theory and combinatorics

## Development

Currently, this project will be migrated and redesigned from my other math lib [Ancono](https://github.com/140378476/Ancono).
